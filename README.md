## About me:
Hello,I am Rabel Memon, a Computer Science student with a growing interest in software development and technology. I am currently learning and practicing programming concepts using Python and Java, and exploring data handling with NumPy.

My primary focus is on building a strong technical foundation, improving problem-solving skills, and understanding how software systems work in real-world applications. I use Notion to organize my learning and academic projects.

In addition to my technical learning, I occasionally engage in writing as a way to reflect and maintain mental clarity, and I also enjoy reading books, which helps broaden my perspective and supports continuous personal growth.
